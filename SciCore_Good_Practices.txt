# SciCore Good Practices
# Meeting with Aurelien 
# 17.12.2021

***********************
*** JOB SUBMISSIONS ***

# Search for max number of CPU requests
---> on SciCore with login20, use command: usage

# Best practice
---> depends on queue
---> use the queue appropraite for job duration
---> prioritize submission of OM simulations to 30min queue
---> limit number of jobs to 30min at 380 (max 400 per user and 1200 per group)
---> use 1-day queue only if urgent

***********************
*** DATA MANAGEMENT ***

# To remove directories on command line
---> single folder: rm -r /path/
---> multiple folders: rsync -a --delete /tmp/empty /tmp/session/
=========> Before running line create an empty directory
=========> in command specify empty folder path then the path of the folder to delete
=========> much quicker
---> zip files and delete

# Tips to reduce data size (for storage)
---> reduce number of monitoring options
---> reduce number of age groups
---> zip the folder to compress size
---> save OM outputs as a binary
=========> see Mimi for example
=========> save .txt files as .csv
=========> compress files

*********************
*** MISCELLANEOUS ***

# Creation of core.#### files
---> produced when job fails (need to check why)
---> remove because of large file size

# Resource requests per job
---> 1GB for OM is sufficient (consider adding this to workflow next year)
---> 2GB max per CPU
